# Quick start


GTDB-Tk is a software toolkit for assigning objective taxonomic classifications to bacterial and archaeal genomes based on the Genome Database Taxonomy [GTDB](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/). It is designed to work with recent advances that allow hundreds or thousands of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to be obtained directly from environmental samples. It can also be applied to isolate and single-cell genomes. The GTDB-Tk is open source and released under the [GNU General Public License (Version 3)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

Notifications about GTDB-Tk releases will be available through the GTDB Twitter account [https://twitter.com/ace_gtdb](https://twitter.com/ace_gtdb).

Please post questions and issues related to GTDB-Tk on the Issues section of the GitHub repository. Questions related to the [GTDB](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/) should be sent to the [GTDB team](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/about).

1. Install GTDB-Tk (or use the third-party web application) ([Running GTDB-Tk](running/))
2. Access the help documentation ([Commands](commands/)), or view the program help menu (`gtdbtk -h`)
