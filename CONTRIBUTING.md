## How to contribute to GTDB-Tk

GTDB-Tk follows [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), 
i.e. all changes must come through a pull request.

#### Step 1: Creating an issue
Firstly, check to see if the issue has already been opened or discussed. If not, 
create the issue. This gives everybody full visibility of the proposed changes you wish to make
and a discussion can take place. 

This is a very good idea to make sure that there are no upcoming changes that conflict
with your proposed changes.

#### Step 2: Fork the repository and create a new branch
After forking the repository, you should create a new branch based on the `staging` branch that
references your issue. 

#### Step 3: Development
Try follow the current coding style as closely as possible. Please try and make sure there are unit
tests where applicable.

#### Step 4: Create a pull request
If you a only wish to discuss your code, open a draft pull request to the `staging` branch.

Otherwise, ensure that all unit tests are passing and open the pull request to the `staging` branch.

#### Step 5: Review and merge
After your code has been reviewed it will be merged into the `staging` branch for the next release.
